Girl my body don't lie (Red One)
I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me (Mr. Worldwide)
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind
So let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
A billion's a new million and
Voli's a new vodka
Forty is the new 30
Baby you're a rock star
Dale veterana, que tú sabe
Más de la cuenta, no te hagas
Teach me baby, or better yet
Freak me baby, yes, yes
I'm freaky baby, I'mma make sure that your peach feels peachy baby
No bullshit broads, I like my women sexy, classy, sassy
Powerful yes, they love to get a little nasty, ow
This ain't a game you'll see, you can put the blame on me
Dale muñequita, abre ahí, and let it rain over me
Girl my body don't lie
I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind
So let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
A billion's a new million
Voli's a new vodka
Latin is the new majority, ya tú sabe
Next step la Casablanca
No hay carro, nos vamos en balsa
Mami you know the drill, they won't know what I got 'til they read the will
I ain't trying, I ain't trying to keep it real
I'm trying to keep wealthy that's for real
Pero mira que tú 'tas buena, y mira que tú 'tas dura
Baby no me hables más, y tíramelo mami chula
No games you'll see, you can put the blame on me
Dale muñequita, abre ahí, and let it rain over me
Girl my body don't lie
I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind
So let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
Mr. Worldwide, Marc Anthony, tú sabe
I was playing with her, she was playing with me
Next thing you know, we were playing with three
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I was playing with her, she was playing with me
Next thing you know, we were playing with three
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Rain over me
Girl my body don't lie
I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me
I'm rising so high
Out of my mind
So let it rain over me (Over me)
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me (Over me)
Ay ay ay
Ay ay ay
Let it rain over me
